<b><i> About "Leigh Bardugo Book Analysis, Selections from SPL": </b></i>

If you are from Twitter, hello! The file you are looking for is the one with TFC at the end, or: https://github.com/LunarCorvidea/seattle_public_library_projects/blob/main/leigh-bardugo-book-analysis-selections-from-spl-TFC.ipynb for the GitHub version (it has a "Add files via upload" note!) or: https://nbviewer.org/github/LunarCorvidea/seattle_public_library_projects/blob/main/leigh-bardugo-book-analysis-selections-from-spl-TFC.ipynb for the nbviewer version. 

I have also added the pivots to this repo for the <i>King of Scars</i> Duology and <i>Wonder Woman: Warbringer</i>, if you'd like to have a browse! Those are bonus materials not included in the notebook. 

The file with the note that says "Create leigh-bardugo-book-analysis-selections-from-spl11.ipynb" contains plotly code that, unfortunately, does not run and made the file far too large for GitHub to handle, but if you wanted to have a look at broken interactive code, you'll have to plug that into nbviewer. I'm still working out the code conflict. The vast majority of the text commentary is the same. 

Thanks for coming!
